A breadboard is what we use to wire all our things together including the Arduino.

We have marked the pin holes that are electrically connected (yellow).

- The top row is all connected together. We use this for voltage to power our things. Notice the red '+'.
- The second row is all connected together. We use this for ground of each of our things. Notice the blue '-'. **Remember: All things need to be connected to ground**!
- Each vertical row is connected together (with a break in the middle).
